    <p>Writing good, robust Unit Tests is not hard -- it just takes
       practice.</p>

      1. Fundamental Principals
    </h2>
    <p>A Unit Test should be short, quick, and automated.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It should verify that a specific part of the program works.</li>
      <li>It should have a clear pass/fail condition.</li>
      <li>It should only test the <em>interface</em> not the _implementation.
      </li>
      <li>It should test the specific functionality of a function, or class.
      </li>
      <li>Every test should be as independent as possible from other tests.</li>
      <li>Each package should have its own Unit Tests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <em>good</em> Unit Test follows these rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The test only fails when a new bug is introduced into the system,
          the interface changes, or new requirements are introduced.
      </li>
      <li>When the test fails, it is easy to understand the reason for
          the failure.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <a href="#test-the-interface-not-the-implementation"
         class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      2. Test the Interface, not the Implementation
    </h2>
    <p>The Unit Test should test the interface to a function or class. It
       should test various combinations of inputs (parameters) and verify
       that the resulting output (result) conforms to the expected
       behaviour.</p>
    <p>The Unit Test for a function or method should test that each parameter,
       or combination of parameters yields the expected output. The test
       should include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Testing invalid types, if the return type is not explicit.</li>
      <li>Testing null values.</li>
      <li>Testing the range (extreme values) of each input parameter both
          valid and invalid.
      </li>
      <li>Testing the various combinations of parameters that have
          inter-dependencies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, an integer (<code>int</code>) parameter should be tested for
       a
       for negative and positive values, both in and out of range, as well as
       zero and null values. if the parameter does not have a strong type
       (i.e. has type <code>Object</code>) it should be tested with non-integer
       types such as <code>String</code>.</p>

                               class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      3. Specific Rules
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Tests should test the <em>interface</em>, not the
          <em>implementation</em>.
           This mean that private variables, functions, fields, and methods
           should not be called directly from the test.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>All values should be typed</em>.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Any variable declared without a value MUST have a type.</li>
          <li>The <code>var</code> declaration should be used sparingly and only
              when the compiler can determine the type.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any data that should not be modified should be created, if
           possible, with <code>const</code>; or, <code>final</code>
           declarations.
           However, <code>final</code> declarations only ensure that the
           variable
           is not modified, not the substructure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any data accessed outside the scope of the test should either
           be constant or should be created with <code>setup</code> and
          <code>teardown</code> functions, so that the initial conditions of the
           test are always the same.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In general, each test file should test only one class
           or type of object. However, if a group of classes share the same
           abstract base class, they might be grouped on one file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In general, only concrete, i.e. non-abstract, classes need
           to be tested. The tests for the concrete classes will test the
           abstract class(es) that they extend.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tests should validate each Getter, Setter, and Method in
           the class. The test should start with the simplest of these and
           proceed through the various levels of complexity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For classes that have been extended, the highest non-abstract
           class in the class hierarchy should be tested first, followed
           by classes that extend that class, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If randomized data generators are being used they should have
           a <em>seed</em> values that allows them to reproduce randomly
           generated data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>setup</code> and <code>teardown</code> functions should be used
                              to
                              to create external data that has mutable
                              (modifiable)
                              state.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All Tests should use the Dart
          <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/test">Test</a> framework.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Code coverage tests should use the
          <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/coverage">Coverage</a>
           framework.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If benchmarking is part of Unit Testing, the Dart
          <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/benchmark_harness">Benchmark
                                                                        Harness</a>
           should be used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>If a mocking framework is needed,
        <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito">Mockito</a> should
          be
          used.
      </li>

      4. Test
      File
      Names
      and
      Structure
    </h2>
    <p>The name of a test file should conform to the following pattern:</p>
    <p><code>test/&lt;name&gt;_test.dart</code></p>
    <p>Where <code>name</code> describes the function, class, or functionality
       being tested.</p>
    <p>Each test file should have the following structure:</p>
    <pre><code>void main () {

  group(&quot;&lt;Group Test Name&gt;&quot;, () {
  
    // Constant definitions
    const List&lt;String&gt; validDates = const &lt;String&gt;[...];
    
    // Final definitions
    final List&lt;Date&gt; validDates = getValidDates(...);
    
    // Group level setup and teardown functions
    &lt;type&gt; setup(...){...}
    &lt;type&gt; teardown(...){...}
    
    test(&quot;&lt;Test 1 Name&quot;, () {
      
      // Local const definitions
      const List&lt;String&gt; x = const &lt;String&gt;[...];
      
      // Local final definitions
      fanal x = ...
      
      // Test level setup and teardown functions
      &lt;type&gt; setup(...){...}
       void teardown(...){...}
       
      // Local variable definitions with explicit types
      
      // Expect group
      //    local definitions
      //    local computations
      //    optional log statements
      //    expect statement
      
      ...
    
    });
    
    test(&quot;&lt;Test 1 Name&quot;, () {
      // another test
    });
    
    test(&quot;&lt;Test 2 Name&quot;, () {
      // another test
    });
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <h2 id="test-directory-and-structure">
      <a href="#test-directory-and-structure"
         class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      5. Test Directory and Structure.
    </h2>
    <p>4. Test programs should be organized in the <code>/test</code> directory
       of the package.</p>
    <p><code>/&lt;package&gt;/test/&lt;name&gt;_test.dart</code></p>
    <p>Each class should have its own test files named as follows:</p>
    <p><code>/&lt;package&gt;/test/&lt;class&gt;_test.dart</code></p>
    <p>If the hierarchy of classes is sufficiently complicated a test
       sub-directory should be created with the name of the base class or
       highest level concrete class.</p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;package&gt;/test
           /&lt;base class&gt;
             &lt;class0&gt;.dart
             &lt;class1&gt;.dart
</code></pre>
    <p>For example, the class structure below:</p>
    <pre><code>Element
  FloatBase
    Float32
      FL
      OF
    Float64
      FD
      OD
  IntBase
    Int16Base
      SS
    Int32Base
      SL
    Uint8Base
      OB
      OBPixelData
      EncapulatedPixelData
    StringBase
      AE
      AS
      ...
</code></pre>
    <p>Should have a file structure similar to:</p>
    <pre><code>/element
  /float
    float32.dart
    float64.dart
  /integer
    ss.dart
    ss.dart
    uint8.dart 
  /string
  ...
</code></pre>
    <p>Where the float32.dart file tests classes FL and OB, etc.</p>

      6  . Guidelines</h2>
    <h3 id="1-know-what-youre-testing"><a href="#1-know-what-youre-testing"

      1.
      Know
      What
      You're
      Testing
    </h3>
    <p>Although this seems like a trivial, it is not always
       easy to follow.</p>
    <p>A test written <em>without</em> a clear objective is usually easy to
       spot.
       It is long, hard to understand, and usually tests more than one thing.
    </p>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with testing every aspect of a specific
       program, function, or class, but problems occur when to
       several such tests are contained into a single test function.
       It creates a complex and fragile Unit Test.</p>
    <h3 id="2-unit-test-names-should-be-descriptive">
      <a href="#2-unit-test-names-should-be-descriptive"

         class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      2. Unit
      Test
      Names
      Should
      be
      Descriptive
    </h3>
    <p>The Unit Test name should describe the purpose of the test. If
       the test is difficult to name it usually means that the test
       lacks focus and is trying to do too much.</p>
    <p>Testing only one thing creates a more readable test. When a
       simple test fails, it is easier to find the cause and fix
       it than to do so with a long and complex test.</p>
    <h3 id="3-unit-tests-should-be-self-sufficient">
      <a href="#3-unit-tests-should-be-self-sufficient"
         class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      3. Unit
      Tests
      Should be
      Self-Sufficient
    </h3>
    <p>Each Unit Test in a file should be able to run separately from
       the other tests in that file.</p>
    <p>A good Unit Test is focused. It avoids dependencies such
       as global data, environment settings, or databases.
       A single test should not depend on running other tests before
       it, nor should it be affected by the order of execution of other
       tests. Running the same Unit Test 1,000 times should return the
       same result every time.</p>
    <p>Using global states such as static variables, external data
       (i.e. registry, database), or environment settings may cause
      <em>leaks</em> between tests. Make sure to properly initialize and
       clean each of the <em>global states</em> between test runs or avoid
       using them completely.</p>
    <h3 id="4-tests-should-be-deterministic">
      <a href="#4-tests-should-be-deterministic"
         class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      4. Tests
      Should be
      Deterministic
    </h3>
    <p>The worst test is one that passes some of the time. A test should
       either pass all the time or fail until fixed. Having a Unit Test
       that passes some of the time is equivalent to not having a test
       at all.</p>
    <p>One practice that should used carefully is writing tests with
       random input. Using randomized data in a Unit Test might introduce
       uncertainty unless the random data can be clearly controlled for
       validity and non validity. If the randomized input is not well
       controlled, then when a test fails, it might be impossible to
       reproduce because the test data changes each time it runs. So,
       it is important that random data generators used in Unit Tests
       be able to regenerate the same data based on a <em>seed</em>.</p>
    <h3 id="5-naming-conventions"><a href="#5-naming-conventions"
                                     class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      5. Naming
      conventions
    </h3>
    <p>To know why a test failed, we need to be able to understand it
       at a glance. The first thing that you notice about a failed
       test is its name -- the test method name is very important.
       When a well-named test fails, it is easier to understand what
       was tested and why it failed.</p>
    <h3 id="6-do-repeat-yourself"><a href="#6-do-repeat-yourself"

                                     class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      6.Do Repeat Yourself
    </h3>
    <p>In production code writing the same code twice should be avoided
       because it causes maintainability issues. However, in Unit Testing
       readability is important, so it is typical to have duplicate code.
       Avoiding duplication in tests cause tests to be difficult
       to read and understand.</p>
    <p>In other words, having to change 4-5 similar tests is preferable
       to not understanding one non-duplicated test when it fails.
       Eliminating duplication is usually a good thing -- as long
       as it does not create obscure code. Object creation can be
       refactored to factory methods and custom assertions can be
       created to check a complex object -- as long as the test's
       readability does not suffer.</p>
    <h3 id="7-test-the-interface-not-the-implementation">
      <a href="#7-test-the-interface-not-the-implementation"
         class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
      </a>
      7. Test the Interface, Not the Implementation
    </h3>
    <p>Successful Unit Tests only test external inputs and output.
       They should only fail when inputs cause an invalid output.
       if the implementations changes, but not the interface, the
       test should still be valid without any changes.</p>
    <p>A <em>fragile</em> Unit Test is one that fails due to an internal
       change in the software that does not affect the interface.</p>
    <p>Fragile Unit Tests result when the same developer that wrote
       the production code, and knows how the solution was implemented,
       writes the Unit Tests. In this case, it is difficult not to test
       the implementation.</p>
    <p>Only test private methods if you have a very good reason to do so,
       otherwise, trivial refactoring can cause errors and failures
       in the tests.</p>
    <h3 id="8-use-an-test-and-mocking-framework">
      <a href="#8-use-an-test-and-mocking-framework"
         class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      8. Use an Test and Mocking Frameworks
    </h3>
    <p>Writing good Unit Tests can be hard when the class under test
       has internal or external dependencies. In order to run a test,
       you may need a connection to a fully populated database or a
       remote server. In some cases, you may need to instantiate a
       complex class created by someone else.</p>
    <p>These dependencies can make Unit Testing difficult. When a
       test needs a complex setup to run, if not handled properly
       a fragile will result.</p>
    <p>To avoid these problems use an Test framework with setup
       and tear-down functions to set default behavior of external
       objects.</p>
